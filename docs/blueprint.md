# **App Name**: Momentum Scroll

## Core Features:

- Search Posts: Implement a search feature to find posts based on keywords. Results are displayed in real-time as the user types, and powered by generative AI. The LLM uses the search query as a tool to filter from the set of posts on the website.
- Marquee Section: Display recent post titles in a smoothly scrolling marquee below the navbar. Clicking a title navigates to the respective post page.
- Hero Section Slider: Implement an auto-rotating slider/carousel displaying top stories with full-width images and overlaid titles. Clicking navigates to the post.
- Recent Posts with Tabs: Showcase recent posts with tabs for 'Trending', 'Recent', and 'Most Viewed', each displayed as a card with image, title, excerpt, category tag, and 'Read More' button.
- Floating Back-to-Top Button: Implement a floating action button that appears after scrolling and smoothly scrolls the user back to the top of the page when clicked.
- Footer with Quick Links: Include a footer with a logo/site name, quick links (About, Contact, Privacy Policy), social icons, optional email subscription, and copyright notice.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #793FDF (a vibrant purple) to evoke creativity and modernity. This purple contrasts well with a light background, ensuring readability and visual appeal.
- Background color: #F5F3FF (a very light purple) to maintain a cohesive look, as this is a desaturated version of the purple primary color. Its high brightness is suited to the light color scheme.
- Accent color: #DF3F4B (a vibrant red, analogous to the purple) to highlight interactive elements like buttons and links. It contrasts in both brightness and saturation with the purple primary, and draws attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface for clean and modern readability.
- Use Font Awesome or inline SVG icons for a modern look and scalability.
- Implement a card-based UI with neumorphism/glassmorphism effects for a modern, soft aesthetic.
- Use subtle CSS transitions for hover effects, loading animations, and smooth scrolling.
