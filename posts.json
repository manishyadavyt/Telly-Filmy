  "excerpt": "ICH NEXT partners with Peclers Paris to launch India-first trend forecasting reports, combining global foresight with deep local research to address a major gap in India’s fashion and lifestyle ecosystem.",
  "content": "New Delhi, India, 21st January 2026: ICH NEXT, India’s leading indigenous trend forecasting platform, announced a strategic partnership with Peclers Paris, a globally renowned consulting agency in creative strategy and prospective trends. The collaboration marks the launch of the ICH NEXT x Peclers Paris Trend Forecast Reports for western fashion categories, aimed at addressing a long-standing gap in India’s fashion and lifestyle industry — the absence of research-led, India-first trend intelligence tailored to local consumers and business realities.\n\nIndia’s fashion and lifestyle market is projected to cross USD 240 billion, growing at over 10% annually. Despite this growth, the industry has traditionally depended on global trend reports that lack relevance to India’s cultural diversity, climate conditions, craft traditions, body types, and consumption cycles. The ICH NEXT x Peclers Paris alliance seeks to bridge this gap by blending global foresight with deeply contextual Indian research.\n\nCo-founders of ICH NEXT, Anuradha Chandrasekhar and Kanika Vohra, highlighted that India is no longer merely adapting global trends but actively shaping them across fashion, beauty, technology, and digital behaviour. They emphasized that trend forecasting in India must move beyond translation to origination, allowing brands to anticipate demand more accurately and identify emerging global cultural and commercial trends originating from India.\n\nLaunched in 2022, ICH NEXT currently serves over 100 brands including Jaypore, Amazon, Myntra, Flipkart, Reliance Trends, Ajio, and Tata Trent brands such as Westside and Samoh. Powered by its proprietary ICHNEXTLABS.ai engine, the platform analyses over 60,000 social and cultural signals and more than 3,000 macro articles each month. Brands leveraging the platform have reported faster design cycles, improved sell-through, and significant revenue growth from trend-aligned launches.\n\nPeclers Paris, part of the USD 20 billion WPP network, brings more than five decades of expertise in fashion, design, beauty, and lifestyle consulting. CEO Anne Etienne-Reboul stated that India’s cultural depth and creative confidence demand a new forecasting approach, making this collaboration uniquely positioned to deliver visionary yet practical intelligence for Indian brands.\n\nThe ICH NEXT x Peclers Paris Trend Forecast Report decodes political, economic, and cultural forces shaping future consumer demand in India, helping brands reduce risk and sharpen design decisions. ICH NEXT is expected to close the current financial year with revenues of approximately USD 0.4 million and plans to double turnover next year while investing USD 1.5 million over the next three years to scale technology and expand category coverage.",

Chatha Pacha also marks Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy’s debut in Malayalam cinema, a collaboration that has already sent anticipation soaring across industries and fan communities alike.\n\nRenowned for crafting soundtracks that transcend generations, the trio’s entry into Mollywood has amplified expectations around the film’s music-driven energy and mass appeal.\n\nThe grand event is scheduled for January 15 at Lulu Mall, Kochi, poised to turn the city into the epicentre of cinema buzz and fan frenzy. While the arrival of Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy marks a historic moment, the spotlight firmly rests on the first-ever trailer reveal of Chatha Pacha; a glimpse that fans have been eagerly waiting for.\n\nWith constant updates, sneak peeks, and music teasers setting social media abuzz, Chatha Pacha is rapidly building momentum as one of the most talked-about upcoming big-ticket releases.

The screenplay is penned by Sanoop Thykoodam, while music is composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, with lyrics by Vinayak Sasikumar, marking a landmark musical collaboration for Malayalam cinema.\n\nThe January 15 event is expected to be a landmark celebration for Chatha Pacha, drawing fans, media, and film personalities in large numbers.

  "excerpt": "Abhishek Sharma opens up about an emotional moment while playing Devansh Singh Chauhan in Zee TV’s Vasudha, revealing how the role brought him closer to his parents.",
  "content": "Zee TV’s Vasudha continues to be one of the most-loved shows on Indian television today, winning hearts with its gripping storytelling, layered characters, and emotional depth. The audience isn’t the only one deeply connected to the narrative; sometimes, the story touches the actors just as profoundly. And recently, actor Abhishek Sharma, who plays Devansh Singh Chauhan, experienced a moment on set that affected him far beyond the camera.\n\nIn the ongoing track, the drama intensifies as Chandrika’s fury only grows as she refuses to even acknowledge him when he comes to meet her. While Dev struggles to calm her, Vasudha faces shocking humiliation at the hotel when the Chauhan Group abruptly cancels her booking, forcing her to vacate the room.\n\nOpening about the experience, Abhishek shared, “There was a scene where Dev breaks down in front of Chandrika, asking her why she isn’t talking to him. While the scene was written with a lot of emotion, I didn’t expect it to hit me personally. After the take, I went back to my room and actually cried. I don’t usually react that way. Something about Dev’s pain triggered something in me. The first thing I did after pack-up was call my parents… and I rarely do that. That moment made me realise how much of Dev’s emotional journey has rubbed off on me.”\n\nHe added, “I was never extremely expressive with my family, but because of Dev, somewhere I’ve opened more. This role hasn’t just helped me grow as an actor; it has brought me closer to my parents without me even realising it.”\n\nAs *Vasudha* builds toward powerful confrontations, heartfelt revelations, and life-changing decisions, the show continues to connect with viewers—and now, even more deeply with the actors who bring its world to life.\n\n*Tune in to Vasudha every day at 9:30 PM, only on Zee TV!*",

  "excerpt": "25 years on, Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s ‘Mission Kashmir’ continues to resonate for its emotion, music, and meaning — here’s why it remains unforgettable.",
  "content": "25 years of Mission Kashmir: A film that redefined emotion, music, and meaning in Indian cinema\n\nIt’s been 25 years since Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s Mission Kashmir first hit theatres, yet the film continues to hold a special place in the hearts of audiences. From its breathtaking cinematography to its timeless music and unforgettable performances, here’s why this landmark movie remains one of Bollywood’s most powerful and emotionally resonant stories.\n\n1. Hrithik Roshan’s unforgettable performance - As Altaaf, Hrithik Roshan delivered one of the most powerful performances of his early career — intense, emotional, and hauntingly real. He captured the turmoil of a boy torn apart by loss and driven by vengeance, blending raw emotion with impeccable physicality in the film’s gripping action sequences. His portrayal brought both fire and fragility to the screen, making Altaaf a character that continues to stay with audiences even 25 years later.\n\n[image1: Hrithik Roshan as Altaaf in Mission Kashmir]\n\n2. Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s deep connection with Kashmir - Few filmmakers capture the heart of a place like Vidhu Vinod Chopra does with Kashmir. Having grown up there, his connection with the valley runs deep, and that authenticity shines through every frame. For him, Mission Kashmir wasn’t just a film — it was destiny. The story reflects his love for the land and his compassion for its people, making it as heartfelt as it is cinematic.\n\n[image2: Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra during the shoot in Kashmir]\n\n3. The picturesque valley and brilliant cinematography - Set against the stunning snow-laden landscapes of Kashmir, the film’s visuals remain iconic even today. The cinematography by Binod Pradhan elevated the storytelling — every shot looked like a painting, and yet carried the raw, lived-in emotion of the place. The valley wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a character in itself.\n\n[image3: The breathtaking valley scenes captured in the movie]\n\n4. Music that became the sound of a generation - With songs like Bumbro, Socho Ke Jheelon Ka Sheher Ho, and Rind Posh Maal, Mission Kashmir delivered a soundtrack that still lives rent-free in the hearts of audiences. The music by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, coupled with Rahat Indori and Sameer’s lyrics, brought together folk roots, rhythm, and emotion in a way few soundtracks have since.\n\n5. A story that remains relevant — even today - At its core, Mission Kashmir is about identity, love, loss, and the human cost of violence — themes that remain timeless. Its moral complexity and emotional honesty made it ahead of its time in 2000, and two-and-a-half decades later, it continues to resonate deeply.\n\nHere’s to 25 years of Mission Kashmir — a film that wasn’t just made, but felt; not just remembered, but relived.",

  "excerpt": "Dangal TV’s Paro Sang Dev presents a mystery wrapped in heartfelt drama, exploring survival, dignity, traditions, and aspirations through the journey of Paro and Dev.",
  "content": "Dangal TV’s Paro Sang Dev brings audiences a captivating new mystery wrapped in heartfelt drama. Known for its impactful storytelling, the channel introduces a unique narrative where survival, dignity, and love collide. The story follows Paro, portrayed by Jahnvi Soni, a spirited village girl who refuses to let poverty crush her dreams, and Dev, played by Arjun Verma, a principled young man from a privileged background. Bound by a lie that leads to an accidental marriage, the show unravels dark truth as the characters seek hope rather than love or belonging. Set against the backdrop of rural India, the show also delves into the clash between traditions and aspirations, highlighting how courage and determination can redefine destiny. With Paro’s resilience and Dev’s idealism at its heart, Paro Sang Dev goes beyond being a love story to become a powerful tale of second chances, perseverance, and the unyielding human spirit.\n\nArjun Verma, who plays Dev, expressed, “The show sheds light on the harsh realities and long-standing misconceptions of rural India. I am truly thankful to Dangal TV for providing me with this opportunity. Rather than offering fairy tales, the story unfolds raw, emotional, and powerful human journeys that embody self-worth, resilience, and the transformative strength of love.”\n\nJahnvi Soni, who brings Paro to life, added, “Paro is a simple village girl with big dreams who, despite endless hardships, never gives up. An accidental marriage changes the course of her life, opening a new path toward her ambitions. The narrative navigates betrayal and heartbreak with self-belief, endurance, and love that heals and transforms — not perfect fantasies, but genuine, heartfelt journeys of triumph. I am grateful to Dangal TV for giving me the chance to portray such a strong female character.”\n\nStay tuned to watch Paro Sang Dev every Monday to Saturday at 10.00 pm only on Dangal TV and anytime on the Dangal Play app.",

  "title": "“My character is the personification of greed,” says Manav Gohil from COLORS’ ‘Binddii’",
  "excerpt": "No prison wall is strong enough to cage a mother’s spirit. COLORS brings a stirring tale of love, betrayal, and resilience in its new drama Binddii.",
  "content": "No prison wall is strong enough to cage a mother’s spirit. Carrying forward its legacy of fearless and raw sagas, COLORS brings a stirring tale of love, betrayal, and resilience in its new drama Binddii.\n\nBorn behind bars, Binddii’s world begins and ends with her mother Kajal, whose warmth turns a prison cell into her haven. But when fate pulls her into the outside world, she is thrown into a ruthless battle where survival is the only choice.\n\nIn the heart of Mathura, Binddii discovers the bitter truth: her father Aviraj’s lies for mafia don Dayanand Chaudhury’s thirst for power shattered her mother’s life. As danger looms and enemies circle once again, Binddii must summon the courage to defy them all and fight for her mother’s freedom.\n\nStarring Radhika Muthukumar as Kajal, Saachi Bhoyar as Binddii, Krushal Ahuja as Aviraj, and Manav Gohil as Dayanand, Binddii airs every day at 8:30 pm on COLORS and JioHotstar.\n\nExcerpts from Manav Gohil’s interview:\n\n1. Tell us about the show.\nA. Binddii is the saga of a daughter’s fight for her imprisoned mother. Born and raised inside prison walls, Binddii’s only world is Kajal, whose love turns iron bars into a haven of joy and hope. But their fragile happiness is shattered when the law forces Binddii out, leaving her unprotected and alone in a hostile world she has never known. When her uncle Saurav takes her to his home in Mathura, the past begins to resurface. She discovers that her father, Aviraj, had conned Kajal, conspiring with the ruthless mafia don Dayanand Chaudhury for money and power. Determined to right these wrongs, Binddii sets out to educate herself and one day free her mother, but the challenge is that Aviraj and Dayanand are closing in on the mother-daughter. The story rides on her inspiring journey to fight this impossible battle that is tilted in favour of the powerful.\n\n2. What drew you to Binddii and your role in particular?\nA. Dayanand Chaudhury is one of those characters who frightens you with their unpredictability. He started as a petty criminal, always scheming for shortcuts to wealth, and over the years, he’s built himself into a mafia don who wears the mask of a respectable man. And yet, for all his darkness, he has this very human layer - his love for his son. He uses acts of kindness as stepping stones for political power. My character is the personification of greed.\n\n3. The show exposes how greed can destroy families. Do you think audiences will see shades of their surroundings in this story?\nA. Absolutely. Greed isn’t only measured in money. It shows up in everyday choices where personal gain outweighs relationships. Most families have seen it in some form. Binddii mirrors this reality through its characters, and audiences will connect with the show.\n\n4. Each character represents a side of society - nurturing, innocent and corrupt. Which side has the upper hand?\nA. Greed and corruption may seem powerful in the moment; yet over time, it is love, innocence, and justice that truly prevail. Families cannot thrive on greed, and societies cannot recover through corruption; they survive because of compassion, resilience, and the fight for what’s right.\n\n5. Dayanand seems like an outright evil man. How did you ensure he feels menacing yet believable?\nA. The scariest kind of evil is the one that doesn’t announce itself. Real menace hides in restraint, in silence, in the ability to look you in the eye and never flinch. His danger lies in his conviction - he doesn’t second-guess, he doesn’t apologise, he doesn’t feel guilt.\n\n6. You’ve played a range of roles over your career. What makes Dayanand stand apart from the others?\nA. Most of the characters I’ve portrayed had a shade of humanity. Dayanand is different. He doesn’t seek your sympathy, he doesn’t need validation, and he certainly doesn’t have a redemptive bone in his body. He thrives on destruction and power.\n\n7. What is scarier: a villain with no remorse or one who justifies every action as ‘necessary’?\nA. Without doubt, a villain who justifies every action. That kind of character doesn’t just harm you, he convinces you that the harm is for your own good.\n\n8. Dayanand thrives on corruption and control. Did you base him on real-world figures?\nA. The world around us gives an actor plenty of raw material. Dayanand is stitched together from fragments of people we’ve seen: politicians, businessmen, and power brokers.\n\n9. Do you see Dayanand as a mirror of real-world power brokers?\nA. Dayanand isn’t fiction; he reflects our society where unchecked ambition mutates into corruption.\n\n10. What is your message to viewers?\nA. I want to thank the audience for the overwhelming response to Binddii. Dayanand may represent everything we dislike in power, but Binddii represents the courage and innocence we need to protect. Keep watching Binddii, every day at 8:30 PM on COLORS and JioCinema.\n\nWitness a daughter’s warrior spirit and a mother’s love that defies all chains in ‘Binddii’; airs every day at 8:30 pm only on COLORS.",

    "content": "They say language is the road map of culture. For child actor Sanchi Bhoyar, who earlier charmed audiences in Marathi with Indrayani, learning Brijbhasha in Mathura became the compass for her first Hindi lead role in COLORS’ ‘Binddii’.Starring alongside Radhika Muthukumar, the show follows the story of a young girl born behind bars, who grows up wrapped in her mother Kajal’s love inside prison, and then has to face the unfamiliar world outside. Set in Mathura, Binddii’s world pulses with the rhythms of its local dialect, which is why Sanchi’s preparation to learn brijbhasha was crucial. Speaking in Brijbhasha doesn’t just ground Binddii to the soil of Mathura but it also makes her dreams and challenges feel real, whether it’s going to school or fighting for her mother’s freedom.Sanchi Bhoyar, playing titular role in COLORS’ Binddii, shares, “This is my very first Hindi television show, so everything feels new and exciting for me. To play Binddii, I had to not only understand her emotions but also learn Brijbhasha, which is spoken in Mathura. At first, it was challenging, because the words and tone are different from both Marathi and Hindi but since we were shooting in Mathura, I began picking up the words directly from the people there. Simple things like saying Radhe Radhe (hello) or calling Radhika ma’am, who is playing my on-screen mother, Maiyya, made me feel like I was living in Binddii’s world. These little words made Binddii real for me, I started feeling closer to her world, and I believe  my efforts will make her journey more real for the viewers",
