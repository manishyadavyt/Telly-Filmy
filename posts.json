    "content": "They say language is the road map of culture. For child actor Sanchi Bhoyar, who earlier charmed audiences in Marathi with Indrayani, learning Brijbhasha in Mathura became the compass for her first Hindi lead role in COLORS’ ‘Binddii’.Starring alongside Radhika Muthukumar, the show follows the story of a young girl born behind bars, who grows up wrapped in her mother Kajal’s love inside prison, and then has to face the unfamiliar world outside. Set in Mathura, Binddii’s world pulses with the rhythms of its local dialect, which is why Sanchi’s preparation to learn brijbhasha was crucial. Speaking in Brijbhasha doesn’t just ground Binddii to the soil of Mathura but it also makes her dreams and challenges feel real, whether it’s going to school or fighting for her mother’s freedom.Sanchi Bhoyar, playing titular role in COLORS’ Binddii, shares, “This is my very first Hindi television show, so everything feels new and exciting for me. To play Binddii, I had to not only understand her emotions but also learn Brijbhasha, which is spoken in Mathura. At first, it was challenging, because the words and tone are different from both Marathi and Hindi but since we were shooting in Mathura, I began picking up the words directly from the people there. Simple things like saying Radhe Radhe (hello) or calling Radhika ma’am, who is playing my on-screen mother, Maiyya, made me feel like I was living in Binddii’s world. These little words made Binddii real for me, I started feeling closer to her world, and I believe  my efforts will make her journey more real for the viewers",
